Roadmap for Synonyms model:

Possibly remove dependency on IGraphableEntity and redefine this more loosely in the Synonyms model
which is a higher level conceptually than the EntityGraph model

Reason: the point of a Synonym is that it can expose the object graph in a more strongly typed way for the
need of that particular concept.

For example, a Content item may need flexibility for linking to different types of content
but a User only needs to be a flat model with links to other Users and Groups (or other items)

IGraphableEntity exposes Attributes, AttributeSchema etc. which would be confusing to consume for the caller on
something like a User

UNLESS we just make it part of the Framework that even the AttributeSchema of a User is definable by the plugin,
i.e. ActiveDirectory specifies a shitload more attributes than a basic MembershipProvider....

Storage:
- Need to move concept of Files / Folders into the Synonyms model
