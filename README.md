RebelCMS - a fork of the discontinued Rebel 5
===============

Why?
===============
We believe that Rebel 5 can be rescued. Lots of good code and functionality can be salvaged.
We have the skills to fix it.

Our short term goals
===============
 - As per Oren's [post](http://ayende.com/blog/156577/on-rebelrsquo-s-nhibernatersquo-s-pullout) we are first focusing on the data layer and ripping out DynamicNode.
 - We want to remove "Nice to haves" and end up with something light-weight that works. 
 - Performance and simplicity is our first main goal.

Our long term goals
===============
 - Performance issues solved
 - Start dealing with backlog and issues
 - A brand new responsive admin User Interface
 - REST API
 - Mono support
 - Heroku and AppHarbour support
 - RavenDB and NoSQL core replacement
 - Continued development and support for "Rebel 5" supporters
