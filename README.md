RebelCMS - a fork of the discontinued Umbraco 5
===============

Why?
===============
We believe that Umbraco 5 can be rescued. Lots of good code and functionality can be salvaged.
We have the skills to fix it.

What we want to accomplishâ€¦
===============
 - Performance issues solved
 - A brand new kick-ass responsive admin User Interface
 - REST API
 - Mono support
 - Heroku and AppHarbour support
 - RavenDB and NoSQL core replacement
 - Continued development and support for "Umbraco 5" supporters

Who do you think you are?
===============
Yes, we've read all the blog posts, we've heard all the critical opinions, but call us crazy we think we can do this. We have rescued a LOT worse!
Our core development team has worked on:
 - BBC.com
 - BBC.co.uk
 - Top Gear
 - Radio Times
 - BBC iPlayer International
 - Mercury Records
 - BBC Good Food
 - Fiction Records

Open Source
===============

Nothing will ever change that. This will be as Open Source as Umbraco is with the same MIT licence. Contributors welcome!
When will this start?

We are already under way! Follow us on Twitter for more updates!
