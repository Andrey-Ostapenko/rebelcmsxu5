Hi! Thanks for grabbing the Umbraco sourcecode.

===========================================
NOTE - WHERE TO FIND V4 CODE - December 2010
===========================================


- With the help of CodePlex we have migrated much of our previous changesets (as of Dec 13th 2010) from TFS to Mercurial.

- However, not everything could be migrated to our new branching workflow. So for each nominal group of 4.x changes, we've created named branches. To switch to the codebase on which you want to work, 'hg update' to the named branch (e.g. "4.6.0") or tag (e.g. "Release-4.5.2") and browse or work from that point.

- The 5.0 codebase is on 'default'. We will make a '5.0.0' branch at the point of the first release, so that subsquent bugfixes can be created on that branch.

Thanks to Matt Hawley at CodePlex for his help in our migration!

Cheers,
The Umbraco Team
